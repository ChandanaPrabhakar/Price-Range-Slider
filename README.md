# Price Range Slider

This project is a simple web application that implements a price range slider. Users can set minimum and maximum price values through both input fields and a draggable slider. The application ensures that the selected price range respects a minimum gap and stays within the specified range.

## Features

- **Interactive Slider**: Drag to set the minimum and maximum price.
- **Input Fields**: Enter the price values directly into the input fields.
- **Validation**: Ensures the minimum price is not less than 0 and the maximum price does not exceed 1000.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts for various screen sizes.

## Files

- **`style.css`**: The CSS file that styles the price range slider and input fields.
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file that adds the interactive functionality to the price range slider.
